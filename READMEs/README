The most basic usage of this package is

  nbspglradmap <nids file>

for example 

  nbspglradmap n0rjua_20110808_1948.nids

The file name must end in ".nids" and start with the "awips" header,
such as n0rjua in this case.

The nbspglradmap (tcl) script will then do the following behind
the scenes. It will exec the nbspgislib programs to convert the
nids file data to shapefile format, and it will then
exec another (tcl) script "nbspglmap". The latter takes as input
the shapefiles and a mapserver "map script" to create the radar image.

The "nbspglmap" script can be used independently and it has many
options to control its behaviour, and in particular it can be used to
create mosaics of several input shapefiles files (e.g. radar mosaics of
a given region covering several sites), as well as other data (e.g. sat)
types.

Thus, in summary, "nbspglmap" is a low level interface while
"nbspglradmap" is a higher level interface for the radar files.

For the interested reader, the "map script template" for the bref
radar images is in the subdirectory "share/nbspgislib/maps".

This package includes some example scripts to illustrate its basic
usage, which also serve as tests, in the directory

       /usr/share/doc/nbspgislibmap/examples

After copying any of the scripts to a directory where you have write
permissions, they can be executed thus:

./ex1-bref.sh jua n0r  (or n0q, n0z, ...)

The script will download (from opennoaaport.net) the "latest" nids file
for the given site/type combination, and will then invoke the
two tcl scripts to cnvert the nids file(s) to shapefile(s)
and finally generate the image using shp2img.

The script

./ex2-bref.sh n0r

will do a n0r composite of the TX sites. The examples directory contains
other similar scripts that can be used as the basis to build your own.
