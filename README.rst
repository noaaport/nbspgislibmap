Overview
========

The Nbsp GIS Map library is a collection of C programs, scripts and
auxiliary files and templates for producing image maps from a variety
of radar (NIDS) and satellite (GINI) data files received via NOAAPort.
It uses the programs of the
`NbspGISlib library
<https://bitbucket.org/noaaport/nbspgislib>`_
to convert the data to the appropriate gis formats and then process the
resulting files using *mapserver*.

The wiki has some examples about usage.
